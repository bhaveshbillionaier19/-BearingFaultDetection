# BearingFaultDetection
This project introduces a CNN-based approach for bearing fault 
prediction using vibration signals. Our model effectively identifies various bearing 
fault types with high accuracy and reliability. This work has the potential to 
revolutionize predictive maintenance in industrial settings by providing early fault 
detection, thereby preventing costly downtimes, production losses, and safety 
hazards. Timely fault identification also allows for proactive maintenance 
scheduling, optimizing resource allocation and minimizing operational 
disruptions.
The project successfully implemented a machine learning approach to detect and 
classify faults in aircraft bearings. The use of a Random Forest classifier, along with 
detailed feature extraction and visualization, provided robust and reliable fault 
detection, crucial for maintaining the safety and reliability of aircraft machinery.
